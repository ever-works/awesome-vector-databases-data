# NucliaDB

[NucliaDB](https://github.com/nuclia/nucliadb) is an open-source AI-powered search database designed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and advanced semantic/vector search across unstructured data. It supports hybrid search capabilities and is tailored for modern AI and ML-powered applications.

## Features
- **Hybrid Search:** Supports vector, full-text, and graph search indexes.
- **Unstructured Data Support:** Designed for storing and searching unstructured data such as text, files, and more.
- **Multi-Tenant:** Built to handle indexing and searching across large, multi-tenant datasets.
- **Data Types:** Store text, files, vectors, labels, annotations, links, conversations, and metadata.
- **Semantic Search:** Perform semantic searches using vectors and NLP, allowing for similarity search beyond exact keyword matches.
- **Text Search:** Traditional keyword and fuzzy text search.
- **Data Export:** Export data in formats compatible with NLP pipelines (e.g., HuggingFace, PyTorch datasets).
- **Field-Level Indexing:** Index fields, paragraphs, and semantic sentences.
- **Cloud Integration:** Cloud data and insight extraction using the Nuclia Understanding API™.
- **ML Model Training:** Connect to Nuclia Learning API™ for ML model training.
- **Role-Based Security:** Role-based access with upstream proxy authentication validation.
- **Storage Backends:** Uses PostgreSQL for the storage layer; supports blob storage with S3-compatible API, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.
- **Replication & Distributed Search:** Replication of index storage and distributed search capabilities.
- **Cloud-Native:** Designed for cloud deployment and scalability.
- **API Access:** Exposes an API for integration into applications.
- **Open Source:** Licensed under AGPLv3.
- **Written in:** Rust and Python.
