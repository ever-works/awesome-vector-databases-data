### Description
CANDY is a benchmark introduced in 2024 for evaluating continuous approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search systems, with a special focus on dynamic data ingestion. This is particularly relevant for assessing next-generation vector databases that must support both efficient similarity search and frequent data updates.

### Features
- Provides a standardized benchmark for continuous ANN search.
- Focuses on scenarios with dynamic (frequently updated) data.
- Useful for evaluating vector database systems' performance under realistic, evolving workloads.
- Supports research and development of efficient ANN algorithms adaptable to dynamic environments.

### Pricing
