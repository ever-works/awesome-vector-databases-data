# ANN-Benchmarks

[ANN-Benchmarks](https://ann-benchmarks.com/) is a benchmarking environment for evaluating the performance of approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms. It provides a platform to compare algorithms across multiple datasets and distance measures.

## Features
- **Benchmarking Platform:** Offers comprehensive benchmarking for a wide range of approximate nearest neighbor algorithms.
- **Multiple Datasets:** Includes datasets such as glove, nytimes, fashion-mnist, gist, sift, word2bits, kosarak, and more, covering various data types and dimensionalities.
- **Variety of Distance Measures:** Supports benchmarking on different distance metrics, including Angular, Euclidean, Hamming, and Jaccard.
- **Algorithm Coverage:** Benchmarks a large selection of algorithms, including faiss-ivf, scann, pgvector, annoy, glass, hnswlib, BallTree(nmslib), vald(NGT-anng), hnsw(faiss), qdrant, n2, Milvus(Knowhere), mrpt, redisearch, SW-graph(nmslib), pynndescent, vearch, flann, luceneknn, weaviate, puffinn, elastiknn-l2lsh, sptag, ckdtree, opensearchknn, datasketch, and more.
- **Interactive Results:** Provides interactive plots and detailed statistics for each benchmark, including recall, queries per second, index size, and build time.
- **Open Source Collaboration:** Users can contribute new algorithms or improvements via pull requests on GitHub.
- **Results Visualization:** Results are split by distance measure and dataset, with summary plots for quick comparison.

## Pricing
