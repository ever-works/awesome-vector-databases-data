name: Product Quantization (PQ)
description: Product Quantization (PQ) is a technique for compressing
  high-dimensional vectors into compact codes, enabling efficient approximate
  nearest neighbor (ANN) search in vector databases. PQ reduces memory footprint
  and search time, making it a foundational algorithm for large-scale vector
  search systems.
