# Gensim

[Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) is an open-source Python library for topic modeling and vector space modeling, widely used for generating high-dimensional vector embeddings from text data. These embeddings can be used for efficient vector search and semantic analysis.

## Features
- **Large-scale semantic NLP model training:** Efficiently trains models for semantic analysis and topic modeling.
- **Text representation as semantic vectors:** Converts text into high-dimensional vector embeddings suitable for vector search and similarity tasks.
- **Semantic similarity search:** Finds semantically related documents based on vector representations.
- **Fast and optimized:** Core algorithms use highly optimized and parallelized C routines for speed.
- **Data streaming:** Capable of processing arbitrarily large corpora with data-streamed algorithms (no requirement for data to fit in RAM).
- **Cross-platform:** Runs on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and other platforms supporting Python and NumPy.
- **Pretrained models:** Access to ready-to-use pretrained models for specific domains (e.g., legal, health) via the Gensim-data project.
- **Open-source:** Source code available under the GNU LGPL license and maintained by the open source community.
- **Easy installation:** Available via pip and conda.
- **Continuous integration:** Automatically tested across multiple platforms and environments.
