# LangChain

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is an open-source framework designed for building applications with large language models (LLMs). It enables integration with various data sources and APIs to support advanced AI workflows, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

- **Open-Source:** The framework is open-source and has a large, active community.
- **Integration with Vector Databases:** Supports integration with vector databases such as Pinecone, Weaviate, and Chroma for efficient retrieval-augmented generation.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Offers SDKs and documentation for both Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Vendor Optionality:** Designed to allow flexibility and future-proofing by making it easy to swap or add new vendors in the LLM workflow.
- **Extensive Integrations:** Connects with a wide array of LLM providers, APIs, and data sources.
- **Building, Running, and Managing LLM Apps:** Can be used alongside other LangChain products (LangGraph, LangSmith) for orchestration, deployment, observability, and evaluation.
- **Developer Tools:** Includes resources such as documentation, changelogs, tutorials, and a community hub.
- **Scalable:** Built to support applications at scale, from prototypes to production deployments.
