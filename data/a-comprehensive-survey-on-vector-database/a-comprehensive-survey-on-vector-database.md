**Category:** Research Papers & Surveys  
**Tags:** vector-databases, survey, ANNS, architecture  
**Source:** [arXiv:2310.11703](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11703)

## Overview
This academic survey provides an in-depth review of vector databases, focusing on their architecture, storage, retrieval techniques, and the challenges they face. Vector databases are specialized systems for storing and retrieving high-dimensional data, a task not well-handled by traditional database management systems.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Overview:** Covers the current landscape of vector database architectures.
- **Algorithmic Approaches for ANNS:** Categorizes and reviews major approaches to the Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) problem, including:
  - Hash-based methods
  - Tree-based methods
  - Graph-based methods
  - Quantization-based methods
- **Challenges:** Discusses existing challenges in vector database design and implementation.
- **Integration with Large Language Models:** Explores how vector databases can be combined with large language models, opening up new application possibilities.
- **Foundational Knowledge:** Offers valuable insights for understanding and building vector database systems.
