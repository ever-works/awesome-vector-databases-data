name: A Comprehensive Survey on Vector Database
description: A comprehensive academic survey that explores the architecture,
  storage, retrieval techniques, and challenges associated with vector
  databases. It categorizes algorithmic approaches to approximate nearest
  neighbor search (ANNS) and discusses how vector databases can be integrated
  with large language models, offering valuable insights and foundational
  knowledge for understanding and building vector database systems.

  # A Comprehensive Survey on Vector Database


  **Category:** Research Papers & Surveys  

  **Tags:** vector-databases, survey, ANNS, architecture  

  **Source:** [arXiv:2310.11703](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11703)


  ## Overview

  This academic survey provides an in-depth review of vector databases, focusing
  on their architecture, storage, retrieval techniques, and the challenges they
  face. Vector databases are specialized systems for storing and retrieving
  high-dimensional data, a task not well-handled by traditional database
  management systems.


  ## Features

  - **Comprehensive Overview:** Covers the current landscape of vector database
  architectures.

  - **Algorithmic Approaches for ANNS:** Categorizes and reviews major
  approaches to the Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) problem,
  including:
    - Hash-based methods
    - Tree-based methods
    - Graph-based methods
    - Quantization-based methods
  - **Challenges:** Discusses existing challenges in vector database design and
  implementation.

  - **Integration with Large Language Models:** Explores how vector databases
  can be combined with large language models, opening up new application
  possibilities.

  - **Foundational Knowledge:** Offers valuable insights for understanding and
  building vector database systems.
