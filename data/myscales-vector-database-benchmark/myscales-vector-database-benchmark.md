# MyScale's Vector Database Benchmark

**Category:** Benchmarks & Evaluation  
**Source:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/myscale/vector-db-benchmark)

## Description
MyScale's Vector Database Benchmark is an open-source framework designed to assess the performance of fully-managed vector databases across various search and retrieval tasks. It provides tools and datasets for benchmarking and delivers comparative results for different vector database solutions.

## Features
- **Benchmarking Framework:** Tools to run standardized performance benchmarks on fully-managed vector databases.
- **Supported Databases:** Includes out-of-the-box support for popular vector databases such as Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant, and MyScale.
- **Workload Types:** Measures throughput and cost-performance for both standard vector search and filtered vector search workloads.
- **Cost-Performance Analysis:** Calculates cost-performance ratio by dividing monthly cost by queries per second (QPS), enabling cost-effectiveness comparisons.
- **Dataset Management:** Provides scripts and modules for dataset preparation and upload optimization.
- **Experiment Management:** Organizes and automates experiments for reproducible benchmarking across multiple services.
- **Results Visualization:** Supports visualization of benchmark results for easier comparison and analysis.
- **Open Source:** Licensed under Apache-2.0 and extensible for custom needs.
- **Hybrid Search Support:** Includes support for hybrid search scenarios in MyScale.
- **Docker Support:** Includes Dockerfiles for containerized environments.
