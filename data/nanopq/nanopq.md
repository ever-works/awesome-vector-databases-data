[Source Code](https://github.com/matsui528/nanopq)

## Description
nanopq is a lightweight library providing a pure Python implementation of Product Quantization (PQ) and Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ) for efficient vector compression and similarity search. It is designed for use cases that require handling large-scale vector data, such as vector databases and nearest neighbor search, and does not depend on any third-party libraries.

## Features
- Pure Python implementation (no third-party dependencies)
- Implements both Product Quantization (PQ) and Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ)
- Suitable for nearest neighbor search
- Efficient vector compression for large-scale data
- Compatible with Python 3.5+ on Linux
- Easy installation via pip

## Pricing
- Open source and free to use (MIT License)
