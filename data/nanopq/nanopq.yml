  ## Description

  nanopq is a lightweight library providing a pure Python implementation of
  Product Quantization (PQ) and Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ) for
  efficient vector compression and similarity search. It is designed for use
  cases that require handling large-scale vector data, such as vector databases
  and nearest neighbor search, and does not depend on any third-party libraries.


  ## Features

  - Pure Python implementation (no third-party dependencies)

  - Implements both Product Quantization (PQ) and Optimized Product Quantization
  (OPQ)

  - Suitable for nearest neighbor search

  - Efficient vector compression for large-scale data

  - Compatible with Python 3.5+ on Linux

  - Easy installation via pip


  ## Pricing

  - Open source and free to use (MIT License)
