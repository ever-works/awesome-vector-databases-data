# Vector Database Group @ NTU

A research group at Nanyang Technological University focused on advancing the theory and practice of vector databases.

## Features
- Specializes in high-dimensional vector data management
- Researches the applications of vector databases in large models, including retrieval-augmented generative AI
- Investigates the transformation of unstructured data (images, videos, texts, speeches) into vectors using deep learning
- Develops techniques for nearest neighbor (NN) search in high-dimensional vector spaces
- Focuses on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search methods
- Provides resources, publications, and tools related to vector database technology
- Explores applications in information retrieval, recommendation systems, and retrieval-based large language models
