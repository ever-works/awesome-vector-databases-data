## Graph-based Methods

**Category:** Research Papers & Surveys

**Description:**
Graph-based Methods refer to a set of vector database solutions and algorithms that utilize graph structures for efficient similarity search and vector indexing. These methods are fundamental to many vector database implementations, especially in AI applications where finding similar items in large, high-dimensional datasets is required.

**Features:**
- Employ graph-based approaches for vector indexing and similarity search
- Enhance efficiency in high-dimensional data retrieval
- Widely used in AI and machine learning applications for nearest neighbor search
- Form the basis for several state-of-the-art vector database systems
