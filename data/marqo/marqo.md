# Marqo

[Marqo](https://www.marqo.ai/) is an open-source neural search engine that leverages vector representations to enable semantic search over textual data. It provides a high-level interface for building advanced search applications and abstracts away the complexity of vector databases.

## Features
- **Semantic Search:** Uses AI to interpret query intent and deliver accurate, relevant results, even for highly descriptive or uncommon search terms.
- **Personalization:** Learns from user behaviors (clicks, add-to-carts, purchases) to personalize search results for each user.
- **Automated Tagging:** Reduces or replaces manual tagging by analyzing images, text, and historical behavior to optimize search rankings.
- **Custom LLM Training:** Trains brand- and domain-specific language models (LLMs) using proprietary frameworks to fine-tune search for each business.
- **Multimodal Search:** Supports searching with images and text (text-to-image, image-to-text, or combined queries).
- **Recommendations:** Provides product recommendations based on customer profile and interaction data.
- **Customizable Search:** Allows boosting products based on margin, sponsorship status, or other business KPIs.
- **Automated Collections:** Automatically generates tags and collections based on relevance and conversion data.
- **Easy Integration:** Connects with product catalogs and PIM systems; minimal UI changes required.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation & Classification:** Supports advanced applications such as retrieval augmented generation and classification tasks.
- **Cloud and On-Premise Options:** Marqo is available as open-source and as a managed cloud service (Marqo Cloud).
