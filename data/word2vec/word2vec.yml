name: Word2vec
description: Word2vec is a popular machine learning technique for generating
  vector embeddings based on the distributional properties of words in large
  corpora. It is directly relevant to vector databases as it produces the
  high-dimensional vector representations stored and indexed by these databases
  for vector search and similarity tasks.
