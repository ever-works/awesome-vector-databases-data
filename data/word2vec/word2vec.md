**Category:** SDKs & Libraries  
**Tags:** vector-embeddings, machine-learning, open-source, python

## Description
Word2vec is a widely used machine learning technique for generating vector embeddings of words, leveraging their distributional properties in large text corpora. It is relevant for applications involving vector databases, as it creates high-dimensional vector representations used for vector search and similarity tasks.

## Features
- Generates vector embeddings for words based on their usage in large corpora
- Suitable for tasks such as word similarity, clustering, and semantic search
- Outputs high-dimensional vectors that can be indexed and searched in vector databases
- Open-source implementation
- Available in Python and other languages

## Pricing
- Open-source (free to use)
