# IntelLabs's Vector Search Datasets

A collection of datasets curated by Intel Labs for evaluating and benchmarking vector search algorithms and databases.

## Features
- Provides code to generate several datasets for similarity search benchmarking and evaluation.
- Datasets are based on high-dimensional vectors from recent deep learning models.
- Includes multiple datasets (see respective folders: `dpr`, `openimages`, `rqa`, `text`, `wit`).
- Each dataset comes with its own README file for details and usage instructions.
- Useful for researchers and developers working on vector search, similarity search, and related benchmarking tasks.

## Notes
- **Project Status:** Not under active management. Intel has ceased development, maintenance, and contributions to this project.
- Users interested in further development or maintenance are encouraged to fork the repository.
