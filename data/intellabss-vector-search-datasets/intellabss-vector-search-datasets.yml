  # IntelLabs's Vector Search Datasets

  A collection of datasets curated by Intel Labs for evaluating and benchmarking vector search algorithms and databases.

  ## Features
  - Provides code to generate several datasets for similarity search benchmarking and evaluation.
  - Datasets are based on high-dimensional vectors from recent deep learning models.
  - Includes multiple datasets (see respective folders: `dpr`, `openimages`, `rqa`, `text`, `wit`).
  - Each dataset comes with its own README file for details and usage instructions.
  - Useful for researchers and developers working on vector search, similarity search, and related benchmarking tasks.

  ## Notes
  - **Project Status:** Not under active management. Intel has ceased development, maintenance, and contributions to this project.
  - Users interested in further development or maintenance are encouraged to fork the repository.
