  # Redis


  [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/reference/vectors/) is a popular
  in-memory data structure store that, with its Search module, provides advanced
  vector similarity search capabilities for AI-driven and information retrieval
  applications. It enables real-time, low-latency vector storage and retrieval,
  supporting both vector-based and traditional hybrid search scenarios.


  ## Features


  - **Vector Similarity Search (VSS):** Perform high-performance vector
  similarity searches using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and range queries.

  - **Indexing Algorithms:** Supports two index types:
    - **FLAT:** Exact search, best for datasets < 1M vectors or when perfect accuracy is required.
    - **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World):** Approximate nearest neighbor search, scalable for large datasets (> 1M vectors), with tunable accuracy and performance parameters (`M`, `EF_CONSTRUCTION`, `EF_RUNTIME`, `EPSILON`).
  - **Vector Types:** Supports multiple vector data types: `BFLOAT16`,
  `FLOAT16`, `FLOAT32`, `FLOAT64`.

  - **Custom Dimensions:** Define vectors of arbitrary dimensions, as required
  by your embeddings.

  - **Distance Metrics:** Choose between L2 (Euclidean), Inner Product (IP), and
  Cosine distance metrics for similarity calculations.

  - **Flexible Storage:** Store vectors and metadata using Redis Hashes (raw
  bytes) or JSON (arrays of floats), with support for multi-value indexing in
  JSON.

  - **Hybrid Search:** Augment vector searches with filtering on text, numeric,
  geospatial, and tag metadata fields.

  - **Advanced Filtering:** Combine vector queries with complex filters (e.g.,
  by text, tags, numeric ranges, geospatial shapes) for precise results.

  - **Runtime Query Tuning:** Override default search parameters at query time
  for HNSW indexes (e.g., `EF_RUNTIME`, `EPSILON`), and control filter modes
  (`HYBRID_POLICY`, `BATCH_SIZE`).

  - **Pagination & Sorting:** Results can be paginated and sorted by vector
  similarity score or document score.

  - **Multi-cloud and Self-managed:** Available as a fully managed service
  (integrated with Google Cloud, Azure, AWS) and as self-managed software.

  - **Real-time Data Synchronization:** Supports near real-time data sync
  without code for fast data access.

  - **In-memory Performance:** Leverages Redisâ€™s in-memory architecture for
  low-latency vector search and data retrieval.

  - **Open Source:** Redis and its vector search capabilities are open source.


  ## Pricing

  No specific pricing information is provided in the available content. Redis is
  open source and available in managed (cloud) and self-managed offerings;
  pricing depends on deployment type and provider.
