name: Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ)
description: Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ) enhances Product Quantization
  by optimizing space decomposition and codebooks, leading to lower quantization
  distortion and higher accuracy in vector search. OPQ is widely used in
  advanced vector databases for improving recall and search quality.
