## Description
A Ball-tree is a binary tree data structure used to organize points in multi-dimensional space. It partitions data points into a nested set of hyperspheres (balls), which makes it particularly effective for applications such as nearest neighbor search, especially in high-dimensional vector spaces.

## Features
- **Space Partitioning:** Organizes points by recursively splitting them into two disjoint sets, each associated with a D-dimensional ball (hypersphere).
- **Binary Tree Structure:** Each internal node represents the smallest ball containing all data points in its subtree; leaves enumerate all points within their ball.
- **Efficient Queries:** Supports fast nearest neighbor searches by pruning subtrees whose balls cannot contain closer points than already found candidates.
- **Construction Algorithms:** Several algorithms exist for constructing ball trees; the simplest is the k-d construction algorithm, which splits data by the dimension of greatest spread and partitions at the median, resulting in O(n log n) build time.
- **Volume Minimization:** Efficient trees aim to minimize the total volume of their internal balls, balancing construction effort and query efficiency.
- **High-dimensional Scalability:** Performs well for nearest neighbor queries as the number of dimensions increases, compared to some alternative structures.
- **Comparison to Related Structures:**
  - *M-tree:* Supports multi-way splits, potentially shallower trees, and is more suited for disk storage.
  - *Vantage-point tree:* Uses a different binary split strategy (one ball and the remainder).
- **Distance Properties:** For a given test point outside a ball, the minimum distance to any point in the ball is at least the distance from the test point to the surface of the ball.
- **Customizable Construction:** The ideal ball tree structure depends on the desired query type and data distribution; heuristics are often used for practical partitioning.

## Applications
- Nearest neighbor search in multi-dimensional and high-dimensional spaces
- Vector databases and similarity search
