  ## Description

  A Ball-tree is a binary tree data structure used to organize points in
  multi-dimensional space. It partitions data points into a nested set of
  hyperspheres (balls), which makes it particularly effective for applications
  such as nearest neighbor search, especially in high-dimensional vector spaces.


  ## Features

  - **Space Partitioning:** Organizes points by recursively splitting them into
  two disjoint sets, each associated with a D-dimensional ball (hypersphere).

  - **Binary Tree Structure:** Each internal node represents the smallest ball
  containing all data points in its subtree; leaves enumerate all points within
  their ball.

  - **Efficient Queries:** Supports fast nearest neighbor searches by pruning
  subtrees whose balls cannot contain closer points than already found
  candidates.

  - **Construction Algorithms:** Several algorithms exist for constructing ball
  trees; the simplest is the k-d construction algorithm, which splits data by
  the dimension of greatest spread and partitions at the median, resulting in
  O(n log n) build time.

  - **Volume Minimization:** Efficient trees aim to minimize the total volume of
  their internal balls, balancing construction effort and query efficiency.

  - **High-dimensional Scalability:** Performs well for nearest neighbor queries
  as the number of dimensions increases, compared to some alternative
  structures.

  - **Comparison to Related Structures:**
    - *M-tree:* Supports multi-way splits, potentially shallower trees, and is more suited for disk storage.
    - *Vantage-point tree:* Uses a different binary split strategy (one ball and the remainder).
  - **Distance Properties:** For a given test point outside a ball, the minimum
  distance to any point in the ball is at least the distance from the test point
  to the surface of the ball.

  - **Customizable Construction:** The ideal ball tree structure depends on the
  desired query type and data distribution; heuristics are often used for
  practical partitioning.


  ## Applications

  - Nearest neighbor search in multi-dimensional and high-dimensional spaces

  - Vector databases and similarity search
