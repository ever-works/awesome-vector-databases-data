# Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is an open source, distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine, scalable data store, and vector database. It is at the core of the Elastic Stack and is widely used for a range of search, analytics, and monitoring applications.

## Features
- **Distributed and Scalable**: Handles data from a single node up to hundreds of nodes, managing large datasets (hundreds of TBs, billions of vectors) with horizontal scalability.
- **Vector Search**: Native support for vector data and scalable vector search capabilities, including integration with the k-NN plugin for efficient similarity search using HNSW and Lucene.
- **Hybrid Search**: Supports combining vector (semantic) search with keyword (lexical) search for advanced information retrieval.
- **Full-Text Search**: Fast and relevant full-text search with fine-tuned relevancy and support for structured, unstructured, geo, and metric data.
- **Analytics**: Aggregations and analytics on large datasets, enabling trends and pattern analysis.
- **Elasticsearch Query Language (ES|QL)**: Advanced query language for transforming and simplifying data investigation and workflows.
- **AI Integration**: The Elasticsearch Relevance Engineâ„¢ enables semantic search, integration with LLMs (Large Language Models), hybrid search, and use of transformer models.
- **Resiliency**: Built-in fault tolerance, cross-cluster replication, and high availability features.
- **Flexible Data Storage**: Supports local fast queries or remote storage (e.g., S3) for cost-effective data management; runtime fields for flexible data onboarding.
- **Machine Learning**: Automate anomaly detection and analytics on data.
- **Security**: Features for securing data and cluster access.
- **Monitoring**: Tools for monitoring the health and performance of the Elastic Stack.
- **Time Series Data Management**: Automate data lifecycle with index lifecycle management, frozen indices, and rollups.
- **Client Libraries**: Official and community-supported clients for multiple programming languages (Java, Python, .NET, SQL, PHP, etc.), with RESTful API and JSON support.
- **Deployment Options**: Available as open source, on-premises, hosted on Elastic Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure), and as a fully managed serverless offering.
- **Use Cases**: Log monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, APM, synthetic monitoring, search and discovery, geospatial analysis, SIEM, and endpoint security.
