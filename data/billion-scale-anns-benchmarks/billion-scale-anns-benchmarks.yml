  # Billion-scale ANNS Benchmarks

  A benchmarking framework for evaluating approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms on billion-scale datasets. It is designed to assess the scalability and performance of vector databases and ANNS methods on very large datasets.

  ## Features
  - Provides a framework for benchmarking ANNS algorithms at the billion-scale level
  - Supports evaluation of both algorithms and hardware for scalability and performance
  - Includes datasets suitable for billion-scale benchmarking (details available on the project website)
  - Resources and guides for running benchmarks and interpreting results
  - Historical results and documentation for NeurIPS 2021 and NeurIPS 2023 competitions
  - Tools for dataset preparation, evaluation, and result visualization
  - Open-source and extensible for new datasets or algorithms
