# Billion-scale ANNS Benchmarks

A benchmarking framework for evaluating approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms on billion-scale datasets. It is designed to assess the scalability and performance of vector databases and ANNS methods on very large datasets.

## Features
- Provides a framework for benchmarking ANNS algorithms at the billion-scale level
- Supports evaluation of both algorithms and hardware for scalability and performance
- Includes datasets suitable for billion-scale benchmarking (details available on the project website)
- Resources and guides for running benchmarks and interpreting results
- Historical results and documentation for NeurIPS 2021 and NeurIPS 2023 competitions
- Tools for dataset preparation, evaluation, and result visualization
- Open-source and extensible for new datasets or algorithms
