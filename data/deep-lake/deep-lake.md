# Deep Lake

[Deep Lake](https://deeplake.ai/) is an open-source vector database designed as a data lake for AI applications. It is built to store and manage various types of unstructured and multimodal data, such as vector embeddings, text, images, videos, PDFs, and audio files. Deep Lake utilizes a tensor format for efficient querying and seamless integration with AI algorithms and frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. It is suitable for similarity search, machine learning workflows, and connecting data to large language models.
