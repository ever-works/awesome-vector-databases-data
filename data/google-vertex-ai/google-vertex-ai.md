# Google Vertex AI

[Google Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) is a fully-managed, unified AI development platform from Google Cloud for building, training, deploying, and managing machine learning and generative AI models at scale.

## Features
- **Managed Vector Search:** Native support for vector search, including hybrid and semantic search for text, image, and other embeddings.
- **Generative AI Models:** Access to Gemini (multimodal), Imagen (image generation), Chirp (speech), Veo (video), and a wide variety of third-party and open-source models (e.g., Claude, Llama, Gemma) via Model Garden.
- **Vertex AI Studio:** Tool for prototyping, testing, and tuning generative AI models, with prompt design, evaluation, and rapid deployment.
- **Custom Model Training:** Train, test, and tune ML models using custom code, preferred ML frameworks, and advanced hyperparameter tuning.
- **MLOps Tools:** Integrated tools for automating, standardizing, and managing the ML lifecycle, including pipelines, feature store, model registry, and monitoring for skew/drift.
- **Agent Builder:** No-code and code-based tools for building and deploying generative AI agents grounded in your data.
- **Notebook Integration:** Vertex AI Notebooks (Colab Enterprise, Workbench) natively integrated with BigQuery and other Google Cloud services.
- **Model Deployment:** Support for batch or online predictions, prebuilt containers, and custom prediction routines.
- **API Access:** SDKs and APIs available for Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, and Curl.
- **Data Handling:** Support for image, video, text, tabular, and multimodal data for training and prediction.
- **Scalability:** Built on Google Cloud infrastructure for high availability, scalability, and security.
- **Modular and Open:** Open integration with OSS ML frameworks and other Google Cloud products.
