## Description

HVS is a graph-based index structure that leverages Voronoi diagrams for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional vector spaces. It is designed to provide efficient similarity search capabilities, making it suitable for large-scale vector data, such as those found in vector databases.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Graph Structure:** Organizes data points in a multi-level graph for efficient traversals.
- **Voronoi Diagram-Based Partitioning:** Utilizes Voronoi diagrams to partition the data space, improving search efficiency.
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search:** Enables fast and effective ANN queries in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Large-Scale Data Support:** Designed to handle large datasets, common in vector database applications.
- **Command-Line Tools:** Provides commands for building the HVS index and performing searches.
- **Example Usage:** Offers running examples (e.g., on ImageNet) to demonstrate functionality.
- **Open Source:** Available as open-source software for community use and contribution.
