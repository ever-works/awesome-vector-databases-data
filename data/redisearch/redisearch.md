## Features

- **Full-text indexing** of multiple fields in Redis hashes
- **Incremental indexing** without performance loss
- **Document ranking** using tf-idf, with optional user-provided weights

- **Sorting of results** (e.g., by creation date)
- **Geoshape indexing**
- **Vector similarity search:**
  - KNN (k-nearest neighbors)
