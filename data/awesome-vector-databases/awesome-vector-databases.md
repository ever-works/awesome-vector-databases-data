# Awesome Vector Databases

A curated directory of vector database solutions, libraries, and resources tailored for AI applications. The list organizes entries by license and type, making it easier to find suitable vector database technologies for various needs.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Categorization**: Covers vector database engines, SDKs/libraries, research papers, benchmarks, data integration/migration tools, curated resource lists, and conceptual definitions.
- **Focus on AI Applications**: Includes solutions and resources specifically relevant to AI, such as vector search, embeddings, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **License and Type Tagging**: Items are clearly tagged by license (e.g., open-source, proprietary) and by type (e.g., managed service, cloud-native, hybrid search, analytics, etc.).
- **Research and Tutorials**: Lists surveys, research papers, and tutorials for in-depth understanding of vector databases and related technologies.
- **Benchmarks & Evaluation**: Provides links to benchmarking tools and datasets for evaluating vector search and database performance.
- **Data Integration & Migration**: Highlights tools and utilities for integrating, managing, backing up, and migrating vector databases, with a focus on real-time synchronization and disaster recovery.
- **SDKs & Libraries**: Includes libraries for vector search, embeddings, similarity search, and integration with major frameworks (e.g., Milvus, LangChain, OpenSearch, Redis).
- **Concepts & Definitions**: Explains key concepts such as ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor), vector search, clustering, scalability, spatial indexing, and compression.
- **Curated Resource Lists**: Aggregates further lists, blogs, datasets, and tools for exploring the vector database ecosystem.
