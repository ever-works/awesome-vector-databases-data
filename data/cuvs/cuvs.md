## Description

cuVS is an open-source library from RAPIDS for fast, GPU-accelerated vector search and clustering, designed to simplify and accelerate vector similarity search and clustering tasks using state-of-the-art algorithms on NVIDIA GPUs. It is derived from the RAPIDS RAFT library and will become its primary home for approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) and clustering algorithms in late 2024.
