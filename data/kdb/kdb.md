## Features

- **Hybrid Search:** Supports combining semantic (dense) and keyword (sparse) vector searches in a single query for increased search relevance.
- **Metadata Filtering:** Allows filtering of vectors using structured metadata to refine search results.
- **Temporal Similarity Search:** Enables searching for similar patterns in time series data, supporting anomaly detection and multi-window queries.
- **Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Handles unstructured data such as text, video, audio, and images for GenAI use cases.
- **Multi-Index Search:** Unifies multiple indexes for multi-layered embeddings, allowing flexible and faster search.
- **On-Disk Indexing:** Utilizes purpose-built qHNSW and qFlat indexing methods to reduce costs and memory requirements.
- **Zero Embedding Search:** Enables rapid search (up to 17x faster, using 12x less memory than HNSW) for fast-changing temporal data without the need for embeddings.
- **Killer Compression:** Provides up to 100x reduction in memory and storage for slow-changing, time-based datasets, and accelerates search by up to 10x.
- **Dynamic Hybrid Search:** Combines similarity, exact, and literal search in a single query, with results adapting to content changes.
- **Integration with GenAI Tools:** Compatible with LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vector-io, OpenAI, Azure AI, HuggingFace, and Unstructured.io.
- **Production-Grade Performance:** Delivers sub-100ms search latency and 99.99% uptime.
- **Scalable:** Supports billion-scale vector storage and retrieval for enterprise and large-scale applications.
