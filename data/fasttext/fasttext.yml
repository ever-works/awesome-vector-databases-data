  # FastText


  [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/) is an open-source, free, and lightweight
  library developed by Facebook for efficient learning of word representations
  and text classification. It is designed to work on standard, generic hardware
  and supports model size reduction for deployment on mobile devices.


  ## Features

  - **Text Representation Learning:** Learns high-quality word embeddings
  (vector representations) from raw text data.

  - **Text Classification:** Provides tools for fast and efficient text
  classification.

  - **Pre-trained Word Vectors:** Offers English word vectors pre-trained on web
  crawl and Wikipedia data.

  - **Multi-lingual Support:** Pre-trained models available for 157 different
  languages.

  - **Model Compression:** Models can be reduced in size to fit on
  resource-constrained devices.

  - **Subword Information:** Enriches word vectors with subword information for
  improved handling of rare and out-of-vocabulary words.

  - **Efficient on Generic Hardware:** Designed to run efficiently on standard
  hardware without requiring GPUs.

  - **API and Tutorials:** Provides a command-line API and comprehensive
  tutorials for ease of use.
