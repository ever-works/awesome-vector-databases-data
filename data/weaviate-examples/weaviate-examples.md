Examples and resources for Weaviate, an open-source vector database optimized for storing and searching vector embeddings at scale.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Example Library**: Contains a wide array of sample projects and tutorials demonstrating how to use Weaviate for different machine learning and vector search tasks.
- **Semantic Search Examples**: Includes semantic search through Wikipedia, wine datasets, and other text corpora using various vectorization models (SentenceBERT, Transformers, etc.).
- **Multi-Modal Search**: Demos for multi-modal text/image search using CLIP, allowing text-based image retrieval.
- **Integration with Popular Libraries**: Examples integrating Weaviate with BERT, Haystack, PyTorch-BigGraph, and more.
- **Image Classification**: Projects such as vegetable classification and attendance systems using image2vec-neural and OpenCV.
- **Question Answering Systems**: Notebooks and code for building QA systems with Weaviate and Haystack.
- **NER and Spellcheck**: Examples showing how to use Named Entity Recognition and spellcheck modules with Weaviate.
- **Custom Vector Usage**: Demonstrations on using your own vectors for search and retrieval.
- **Monitoring and Operations**: Setup guides for Prometheus and Grafana monitoring with Weaviate.
- **Web and GUI Applications**: Example web apps for movie recommendation, toxic comment classification (with Tkinter GUI), and plant information search using NodeJS and JavaScript.
- **Workshops and Tutorials**: Jupyter/Colab notebooks from conference workshops to help users get started with vector search and question answering in Weaviate.
- **Data Profiling**: Example for generating data profiles of data stored in a Weaviate cluster using pandas.
- **Docker Compose Configurations**: Example configurations for demo datasets and module integrations.
