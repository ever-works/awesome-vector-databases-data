## Description
VectorDBBench is a benchmarking tool developed by ZillizTech, designed to evaluate and compare the performance and cost-effectiveness of various mainstream vector databases and cloud services. It provides unbiased benchmark results to help users select the most suitable vector database solutions for their needs.

## Features
- **Benchmarking for Vector Databases:** Provides comparative performance and cost benchmarks for a wide range of vector databases and cloud services.
- **Comprehensive Performance Metrics:** Measures and ranks databases using key metrics such as Queries Per Second (QPS), P99 Latency, and Recall (accuracy).
- **Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation:** Includes cost ranking tables that detail the cost-performance ratio and estimate cost per million queries.
- **Reproducible Results:** Designed for ease of use, enabling both professionals and non-professionals to reproduce tests and benchmark results.
- **Comparison Tables:** Offers detailed ranking tables for QPS (throughput), P99 latency (response speed), and cost, with breakdowns by database, hardware configuration, and test scenario.
- **Multiple Test Scenarios:** Supports various filter settings and query scenarios, including tests with different AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) and filter conditions (none, low, high).
- **Open-Source and Cloud Database Coverage:** Benchmarks include both open-source and cloud-hosted vector databases.
- **Transparent Scoring Rule:** Comprehensive scoring system for fair comparison, with scoring rules available for review.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed to be accessible for users of all experience levels.
