  ## Description

  VectorDBBench is a benchmarking tool developed by ZillizTech, designed to
  evaluate and compare the performance and cost-effectiveness of various
  mainstream vector databases and cloud services. It provides unbiased benchmark
  results to help users select the most suitable vector database solutions for
  their needs.


  ## Features

  - **Benchmarking for Vector Databases:** Provides comparative performance and
  cost benchmarks for a wide range of vector databases and cloud services.

  - **Comprehensive Performance Metrics:** Measures and ranks databases using
  key metrics such as Queries Per Second (QPS), P99 Latency, and Recall
  (accuracy).

  - **Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation:** Includes cost ranking tables that detail
  the cost-performance ratio and estimate cost per million queries.

  - **Reproducible Results:** Designed for ease of use, enabling both
  professionals and non-professionals to reproduce tests and benchmark results.

  - **Comparison Tables:** Offers detailed ranking tables for QPS (throughput),
  P99 latency (response speed), and cost, with breakdowns by database, hardware
  configuration, and test scenario.

  - **Multiple Test Scenarios:** Supports various filter settings and query
  scenarios, including tests with different AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) and
  filter conditions (none, low, high).

  - **Open-Source and Cloud Database Coverage:** Benchmarks include both
  open-source and cloud-hosted vector databases.

  - **Transparent Scoring Rule:** Comprehensive scoring system for fair
  comparison, with scoring rules available for review.

  - **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed to be accessible for users of all
  experience levels.


  ## Pricing

  No pricing information is provided for VectorDBBench itself; it is presented
  as a free benchmarking tool.
