  ## Description

  Neo4j is a graph database that supports integrated vector search capabilities
  (since version 5.11), enabling hybrid graph and vector-based similarity
  search. It is widely used for building knowledge graphs, advanced querying,
  and integrating with generative AI and data science workflows.


  ## Features

  - **Graph Database:** Native property graph storage and querying.

  - **Vector Search:** Integrated vector search and indexing for similarity
  search within graph data (since v5.11).

  - **Hybrid Search:** Combine graph-based and vector-based queries for advanced
  retrieval.

  - **Cypher Query Language:** Declarative language for graph querying and
  manipulation.

  - **Deployment Options:** Supports self-managed (on-premises), fully managed
  cloud (Neo4j Aura), Docker, and Kubernetes deployments.

  - **Data Import:** Tools for importing data from various sources, including
  CSV, relational databases, and cloud data warehouses.

  - **Visualization Tools:** Neo4j Bloom and Browser for data exploration and
  visualization.

  - **Graph Data Science Library:** Built-in algorithms and machine learning
  models for graph analytics.

  - **Developer Tools:** Official drivers (Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, .NET),
  APIs, and libraries for application development.

  - **Connectors:** Integration with Apache Spark, Kafka, BigQuery, Google
  Cloud, and more.

  - **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Real-time monitoring of data changes.

  - **Security:** User, role, and privilege management, Kerberos support.

  - **Backup and Restore:** Tools for data backup, export, and restore.

  - **Monitoring:** Database monitoring and management tools.

  - **Extensibility:** Support for plugins (APOC, Neosemantics, etc.), custom
  procedures, and integrations with frameworks (Spring Data, GraphQL, etc.).

  - **RDF & Linked Data:** RDF and semantic web capabilities via Neosemantics
  and RDFLib-Neo4j.

  - **GenAI Integrations:** Tools and libraries for integrating with LLMs and
  generative AI (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.).
