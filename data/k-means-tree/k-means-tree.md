## Description
K-means Tree is a clustering-based data structure designed to organize high-dimensional vectors for efficient similarity search and retrieval. It is commonly used as an indexing method in vector databases to optimize the performance of vector search operations.

## Features
- **Clustering-based Structure:** Organizes data points hierarchically using k-means clustering at each node to partition the data set.
- **Efficient Similarity Search:** Enables fast nearest neighbor search by recursively narrowing down the search space to relevant clusters.
- **Scalable to High Dimensions:** Designed to handle high-dimensional vector data, which is common in applications like image retrieval, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.
- **Indexing Method:** Used as an indexing method in vector databases to accelerate vector search and retrieval tasks.
- **Supports Approximate Search:** Can be used for approximate nearest neighbor search, trading off some accuracy for significant speed improvements, especially in high-dimensional settings.
- **Optimized for Performance:** Reduces the number of distance computations required for similarity search, leading to faster query times compared to brute-force methods.

## Use Cases
- Vector search in databases
- Image, text, and multimedia retrieval
- Recommendation systems
- Machine learning and data mining tasks involving high-dimensional data
